This directory contains work on the following 

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is a PID
What is a process
How to find a processâ€™ PID
How to kill a process
What is a signal
What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

0. What is my PID
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

1. List your processes
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

Requirements:

Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
Display in a user-oriented format
Show process hierarchy

2. Show your Bash PID
mandatory
Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:

You cannot use pgrep
The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here)

3. Show your Bash PID made easy
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

Requirements:

You cannot use ps
Here we can see that:

For the first iteration: bash PID is 4404 and that the 3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy script PID is 4555
For the second iteration: bash PID is 4404 and that the 3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy script PID is 4557

4. To infinity and beyond
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

Requirements:

In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2

5. Don't stop me now!
mandatory
We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You must use kill

I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my 4-to_infinity_and_beyond Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run 5-dont_stop_me_now. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.

6. Stop me if you can
mandatory
Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You cannot use kill or killall

7. Highlander
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays:

To infinity and beyond indefinitely
With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 67-stop_me_if_you_can in terminal #1, for every iteration we can see I am invincible!!! appearing in terminal #0.

8. Beheaded process
mandatory
Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

Terminal #0
I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 8-beheaded_process in terminal #1 and we can see that the 7-highlander has been killed.
